Mentoring at SheCodes was a great opportunity as it allowed me to support interested like minded females who wanted to learn about programming.

Whilst mentoring at SheCodes I was designated a group that was tasked with creating a product of their own imagination; similar to a hackathon. This task allowed the students to experience a realistic environment for working as team on a product with people with different ranges of skills, personalities, and a dynamic chancing product requirements. As a mentor I was tasked with supporting the students with preforming:

- Agile & SCRUM practices
- Project management & MVP
- Architecture & team with different roles
- Properly managing code as a team
- React, Django, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, Git
